EXPLANATION – PART A & B

A) Complexity Analysis
----------------------
The first algorithm (TetranacciMultiple) is exponential because every call
generates 4 more recursive calls, resulting in roughly O(4^n) growth.
It repeatedly recalculates the same subproblems multiple times.

The second algorithm (TetranacciLinear) is linear O(n) because it stores
previously computed results in a memoization structure, preventing repeated
computation of the same subproblems.

B) Tail Recursion
-----------------
Neither of the first two algorithms is tail-recursive because each performs
additional computations after recursive calls.

A tail-recursive version can be designed by carrying forward the last four
computed values as parameters (a, b, c, d). Each call passes updated values
forward without pending operations, allowing the compiler to optimize it into
an iterative process.
