Multiple Tetranacci

1 - Given the simplicity of this version of the Tetranacci program, there are only minimal differences between our version and the AI.
One difference lies in the timing measurement; the AI is using elapsed time to clarify the exact purpose of each variable.

2 - Another difference is the format of the output; our version uses printf which allows more control over the formatting.
